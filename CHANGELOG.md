# Globalize Changelog

## 4.0.0.alpha.3 (2013-12-18)

* Move ActiveRecord::Relation#where_values_hash patch into globalize relation class to avoid monkeypatching.
* Add Code Climate Score (thanks [BrandonMathis](https://github.com/BrandonMathis)).
* Query using Globalize.fallbacks rather than locale only when fetching a record (thanks [@huoxito](https://github.com/huoxito)).
* Use a module (QueryMethods) rather than a class for overriding functionality of ActiveRecord::Relation.
* Use ActiveRecord::Relation#extending! to extend ActiveRecord::Core#relation with QueryMethods, works with associations as well.

## 4.0.0.alpha.2 (2013-10-24)

* Add license to gemspec.
* Update references to ActiveRecord 3 -> ActiveRecord.
* Replace references to globalize3 with globalize and remove references to ActiveRecord 3.x.
* Document `3-0-stable` branch in readme.
* Convert test syntax to MiniTest::Spec.
* Extract easy accessors functionality, moved to new [globalize-accessors](https://github.com/globalize/globalize-accessors) gem.
* Check that `first` is not nil before reloading translations, fixes [#282](https://github.com/globalize/globalize/issues/282).
* Duplicate arguments in query finders before modifying them, fixes [#284](https://github.com/globalize/globalize/issues/284).

## 3.0.1 (2013-11-07)
